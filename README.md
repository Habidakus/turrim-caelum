This simple bullet heaven game was created, mostly, so that I could learn to use Godot.

There isn't any great design effort here, and certainly no laudible art in this game.
Heck, even the coding isn't that interesting.

It's just here so that I can, soup to nuts, make a complete game in Godot. I've imposed a limit of 120 hours (three work weeks) of time that I'll invest in it.

If you found any enjoyment in it, that's above and beyond any expectations on my part.
